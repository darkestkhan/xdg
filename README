A small library that should make it at least slightly easier to follow XDG
guidelines.

To build for particular CPU use environment variable CPU or put
`-XCPU="options"` switch to gprbuild.
CPU options default to "-m64 -mssse3 -march=native -fPIC".

To build for Windows use `-XOS=Windows` switch for gprbuild.
[Windows support is untested, proceed at your own peril]

This library is under GMGPLv3+.
